# Surgical-task-Classification-using-GANs-and-CNN

We used the SurgVisdom challenge dataset for this project. Uploaded the three code files. Trainig_Generative_Model.ipynb contains the all required code for extracting
images and training model. Image classification code file have the CNN code for classification purposes. And last file is to compute the results.
